Quick start
-----------

First of all, you need to make sure you have latest stable `node` and `npm` packages installed.

    $ node -v
    v0.12.2

    $ npm -v
    2.7.5

then you need to globally install `gulp`

    $ npm install -g gulp

then you need to install the requirements

    $ npm install

and finally run build system to fetch the font, compile css and so on

    $ gulp

At that point you should be able to point your browser to http://localhost:4000/ and see the the page.
